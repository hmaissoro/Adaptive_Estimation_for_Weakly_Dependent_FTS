\title{Arctan Hurst function}
\usage{
hurst_arctan(t = seq(0.2, 0.8, len = 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{\code{vector (float)}. Points between 0 and 1 at which to evaluate the function.}
}
\value{
A \code{vector (float)} corresponding to the value of the function evaluated at \code{t}.
}
\description{
Arctan Hurst function that can be used to generate multifractional Brownian motion (mfBm).
See the following paper https://doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract6020074.

\examples{

t0 <- seq(0.2, 0.8, len = 10)
htan <- hurst_arctan(t = t0)
plot(x = t0, y = htan, type = "b", col = "red")
