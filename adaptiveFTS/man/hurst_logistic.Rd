\title{Logistic Hurst function}
\usage{
hurst_logistic(
  t,
  h_left = 0.2,
  h_right = 0.8,
  slope = 30,
  change_point_position = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{\code{vector (float)}. Points between 0 and 1 at which to evaluate the function.}

\item{h_left}{\code{Float}. A scalar value in the interval between 0 and 1 indicating the minimum of the function.}

\item{h_right}{\code{Float}. A scalar value in the interval between 0 and 1 indicating the maximum of the function.}

\item{slope}{\code{Float (positive)}. A scalar positive value corresponding to the slope of the logistic function.}

\item{change_point_position}{\code{Float}. A scalar value in the interval between 0 and 1 corresponding ti the change point position.}
}
\value{
A \code{vector (float)} corresponding to the value of the function evaluated at \code{t}.
}
\description{
Logistic Hurst function that can be used to generate multifractional Brownian motion (mfBm).
See the following paper https://doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract6020074.
