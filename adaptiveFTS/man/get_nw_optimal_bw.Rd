\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.table (or data.frame)} or \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} or \code{list} of \code{list}.
\itemize{
   \item{If \code{data.table}}{
       It must contain the raw binding of the curve observations with at least 3 columns.
       \itemize{
         \item{\code{idcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
                             Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.}
         \item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observation points associated to each curve index.}
         \item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observed value of a curve at each point of observation and for each index of the curve.}
       }
   }
   \item{If \code{list} of \code{data.table}}{
        In this case, each element of the given \code{list} corresponds to the observation scheme of a curve, which is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.
        The data.table contains at least 2 columns.
        \itemize{
         \item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observation points associated to the curve.}
         \item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curve.}
       }
   }
   \item{If \code{list} of \code{list}}{
     In the latter case, the \code{data} is a list \code{list} where each element is the observation scheme of a curve given as a \code{list} of 2 vectors.
     \itemize{
         \item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the vector that contains the observation points associated the curve.}
         \item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the vector that contains the observed value of the curve.}
       }
   }
}}

\item{idcol}{\code{character}. If \code{data} is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame},
it is the name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.
Opposite, if f \code{data} is given as \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} of \code{list} of \code{list}, \code{idcol = NULL.}}

\item{tcol}{\code{character}. The name of the column (or vector) that contains the observation points associated to the curves.}

\item{ycol}{\code{character}. The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curves.}

\item{bw_grid}{\code{vector (numeric)}. The cross-validation bandwidth grid.
Default \code{bw_grid = NULL} and so it will be set as an exponential grid using the average of the number of observation points per curve.}

\item{nsubset}{\code{integer (positive integer)}. The number of subset curves to be randomly and uniformly selected.
Default \code{nsubset = NULL} and thus an optimal bandwidth is calculated for each curve.}

\item{smooth_ker}{\code{function}. The kernel function of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator.
Default \code{smooth_ker = epanechnikov}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} containing the following columns.
         \itemize{
           \item{id_curve :}{The index of the curve.}
           \item{optbw :}{ The optimal bandwidth obtained by Cross-Validation.}
        }
