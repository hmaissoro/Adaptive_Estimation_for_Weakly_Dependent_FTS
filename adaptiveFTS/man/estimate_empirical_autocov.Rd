\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.table (or data.frame)} or \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} or \code{list} of \code{list}.
\itemize{
   \item{If \code{data.table}}{
       It must contain the raw binding of the curve observations with at least 3 columns.
       \itemize{
         \item{\code{idcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
                             Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.}
         \item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observation points associated to each curve index.}
         \item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observed value of a curve at each point of observation and for each index of the curve.}
       }
   }
   \item{If \code{list} of \code{data.table}}{
        In this case, each element of the given \code{list} corresponds to the observation scheme of a curve, which is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.
        The data.table contains at least 2 columns.
        \itemize{
         \item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observation points associated to the curve.}
         \item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curve.}
       }
   }
   \item{If \code{list} of \code{list}}{
     In the latter case, the \code{data} is a list \code{list} where each element is the observation scheme of a curve given as a \code{list} of 2 vectors.
     \itemize{
         \item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the vector that contains the observation points associated the curve.}
         \item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the vector that contains the observed value of the curve.}
       }
   }
}}

\item{idcol}{\code{character}. If \code{data} is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame},
it is the name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.
Opposite, if f \code{data} is given as \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} of \code{list} of \code{list}, \code{idcol = NULL.}}

\item{tcol}{\code{character}. The name of the column (or vector) that contains the observation points associated to the curves.}

\item{ycol}{\code{character}. The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curves.}

\item{t}{\code{vector (numeric)}. Observation points at which we want to estimate the empirical autocovariance function.}

\item{lag}{\code{vector (integer)}. Lag of the autocovariance.}

\item{h}{\code{numeric (positive vector or scalar)}. The smoothing bandwidth parameter.
Default \code{h = NULL} and thus it will be estimated by Cross-Validation on a subset of curves.
If \code{h} is a \code{scalar}, then all curves will be smoothed with the same bandwidth.
Otherwise, if \code{h} is a \code{vector}, its length must be equal to the number of curves in \code{data}
and each element of the vector must correspond to a curve given in the same order as in \code{data}.}

\item{smooth_ker}{\code{function}. The kernel function of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Default \code{smooth_ker = epanechnikov}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with three columns: \code{t}, \code{lag} and \code{autocov} corresponding to the estimated autocovariance.
