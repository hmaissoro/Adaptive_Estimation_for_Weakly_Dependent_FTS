\itemize{
   \item{If \code{data.table}}{
       It must contain the raw binding of the curve observations with at least 3 columns.
       \itemize{
         \item{\code{idcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
                             Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.}

   \item{If \code{list} of \code{data.table}}{
        In this case, each element of the given \code{list} corresponds to the observation scheme of a curve, which is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.
        The data.table contains at least 2 columns.

   \item{If \code{list} of \code{list}}{
     In the latter case, the \code{data} is a list \code{list} where each element is the observation scheme of a curve given as a \code{list} of 2 vectors.

\item{idcol}{\code{character}. If \code{data} is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame},
it is the name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.
Opposite, if f \code{data} is given as \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} of \code{list} of \code{list}, \code{idcol = NULL.}}

\item{tcol}{\code{character}. The name of the column (or vector) that contains the observation points associated to the curves.}

\item{ycol}{\code{character}. The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curves.}

\item{s}{\code{vector (numeric)}. First argument of the autocovariance function.
It corresponds to the observation points \code{s} in the pair (\code{s}, \code{t}).
It has to be of the same length as the \code{t}}

\item{t}{\code{vector (numeric)}. Second argument of the autocovariance function.
It corresponds to the observation points \code{t} in the pair (\code{s}, \code{t}).
It has to be of the same length as the \code{s}.}

\item{lag}{\code{integer (positive integer)}. Lag of the autocovariance.}

\item{p}{\code{numeric (integer)}. It is used as exponent.}

\item{q}{\code{numeric (integer)}. It is used as exponent.}

\item{h}{\code{numeric (positive scalar)}. The bandwidth of the estimator.}

\item{dt_mean_rp}{\code{data.table}. It contains the estimates of the mean function at each observation point for each curve.
The name of the curve identification column must be \code{id_curve}, the observation points column \code{tobs} and the mean estimates column \code{muhat_RP}.
Default \code{dt_mean_rp = NULL} and so it will be estimated.}

\item{optbw_mean}{\code{numeric (positive scalar)}. Optimal bandwidth for the mean function estimator.
It is \code{NULL} if \code{dt_mean_rp} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{smooth_ker}{\code{function}. The kernel function of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator.
Default \code{smooth_ker = epanechnikov}.}
